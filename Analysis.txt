Task0.py Worst Case Big O Calculation: O(11)
Justification: The first record needs to be retrieved (+1). Then the three records
within the first record needs to be retrieved (+3), and then they are printed (+1).
Next, the second record is retrieved (+1), and the four items within that record are
retrieved (+4). Then, the records are printed (+1).

Task1.py Worst Case Big O Calculation: O(4n + 4p + 2)
Justification: The first list, texts, retrieves two items and adds each one 
for each iteration (4n). The second list, calls, retrieves two items add adds each one
for each iteration (4p). Finally, the set, unique_nums_set, is counted and printed (+2).

Task2.py Worst Case Big O Calculation:O(4n + 3)
Justification: The first for loop converts each item of time in the list, calls, to an integer (n).
Next, the second for loop using calls, either creates a new entry or adds a time to an existing 
entry in the dictionary, call_dict (n). Then, assuming the worst case scenario that every iteration of time
is greater than the previous iteration of time in the call_dict, a new number and a new time is added
to the max_list, a list with two items, the phone number, and the max time (2n). Finally, two items are
retrieved and printed from max_list (+3).
